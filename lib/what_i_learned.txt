day 2 I learned that tween is simply represent x axis on which animtion will take place(idle 0.0-1.0)
aniamtion is simply double value which change according to animationController value with calculation of Tween 
animation if we put animationControllerValue in transform widget then it will show static animation like moving one place to another
but when we use animation as transform value then it will show diffrent transiton animation.
